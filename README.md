### 💡 About Me

I’m a **Frontend Engineer and Workflow Automation Specialist** passionate about transforming how startups grow — by combining **clean UI**, **WCAG 2.2 accessibility**, and **automated systems** that drive visibility and revenue.
<!--
Currently, I’m **building [Almawaqeet](#)** — a **PropTech platform** that connects travel and housing seekers with verified developers while prioritizing **speed, accessibility, and trust**.-->

### 🧠 My Tech Niche

I sit at the intersection of:
- 🏗 **PropTech + TravelTech**
- ⚙️ **Automation & No-Code Systems**
- 🌍 **Performance-driven Frontend Development**

I build scalable, accessible, and search-optimized web experiences using:
> `React.js` | `Next.js` | `TypeScript` | `Supabase` | `PostgreSQL` | `Prisma` |  
> `Node.js` | `Express.js` | `MongoDB` | `Zapier` | `Airtable`

### 🧩 My Philosophy

> “Great code means nothing if no one finds or can use it.”

So I build products that:
- Load fast ⚡ (optimized Core Web Vitals)
- Communicate clearly 🗣️ (SEO + UX writing)
- Work for everyone ♿ (WCAG 2.2 accessibility)
- Operate efficiently 🔁 (automation that saves time and reduces redundancy)
